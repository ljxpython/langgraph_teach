可能包含问题或话题的描述，以帮助模型生成正确的答案\n\n实例二：在情感分析任务中，让模型做情感分类任务的做法通常是在句子前面加入前缀 ' 该句子的情感是 ' 即可， 通过这种方式 将情感分类任务转换为一个 ' 填空 ' 任务，在训练过程中， BERT 可以学习到这个前缀与句子情感之 间的关联。例如，它可以学习到 ' 该句子的情感是积极的 ' 和 ' 该句子的情感是消极的 ' 之间的差异。\n\n2023 年 09 月 18 日 20:58\n\n扫码加\n\n查看更多\n\n三、提示学习（ Prompting ） 有什么优点？\n\n提示学习（ Prompting ）旨在 通过最小化微调参数的数量和计算复杂度，来提高预训练模型在新任务上的性能，\n\n从而缓解大型预训练模型的训练成本 。这样一来，即使计算资源受限，也可以利用预训练模型的知识来迅速适应

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

Its layout follows a left-to-right linear flow representing the workflow: 1) A left rectangular box labeled '输入文本' (Input Text) with an example sentence; 2) A highlighted blue block labeled '添加指示性提示' (Add Indicative Prompt) inserting a task-specific prompt (e.g., '判断情感：') before the input; 3) A central block labeled '预训练语言模型' (Pre-trained Language Model) with a simplified neural network icon; 4) A right output box labeled '输出结果' (Output Result) showing the model’s response (e.g., '积极'). \n\nDirectional arrows connect these elements to indicate sequence. The color scheme is monochromatic with blue accents for the prompt block to emphasize its role. Lines are crisp, text uses a sans-serif font, and the style is minimalist, suitable for technical documentation. \n\nThis diagram aligns with the surrounding context of section 4.2 '指示微调（Prompt-tuning）篇' in the AiGC Interview Guide, specifically supporting subsection 4.2.2 '指示微调思路是什么?'

If the entity name is case-insensitive, capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case). Ensure **consistent naming** across the entire extraction process.\n        *   `entity_type`: Categorize the entity using one of the following types: `Person,Creature,Organization,Location,Event,Concept,Method,Content,Data,Artifact,NaturalObject`. If none of the provided entity types apply, do not add new entity type and classify it as `Other`.\n        *   `entity_description`: Provide a concise yet comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, based *solely* on the information present in the input text.\n    *   **Output Format - Entities:** Output a total of 4 fields for each entity, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line.

Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `target_entity`: The name of the target entity. Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `relationship_keywords`: One or more high-level keywords summarizing the overarching nature, concepts, or themes of the relationship. Multiple keywords within this field must be separated by a comma `,`. **DO NOT use `<|#|>` for separating multiple keywords within this field.**\n        *   `relationship_description`: A concise explanation of the nature of the relationship between the source and target entities, providing a clear rationale for their connection.\n    *   **Output Format - Relationships:** Output a total of 5 fields for each relationship, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line. The first field *must* be the literal string `relation`.\n        *   Format: `relation<|#|>source_entity<|#|>target_entity<|#|>relationship_keywords<|#|>relationship_description`\n\n3.  **Delimiter Usage Protocol:**\n    *   The `<|#|>` is a complete, atomic marker and **must not be filled with content**.

    "original_prompt": "---Task---\nBased on the last extraction task, identify and extract any **missed or incorrectly formatted** entities and relationships from the input text.\n\n---Instructions---\n1.  **Strict Adherence to System Format:** Strictly adhere to all format requirements for entity and relationship lists, including output order, field delimiters, and proper noun handling, as specified in the system instructions.\n2.  **Focus on Corrections/Additions:**\n    *   **Do NOT** re-output entities and relationships that were **correctly and fully** extracted in the last task.\n    *   If an entity or relationship was **missed** in the last task, extract and output it now according to the system format.\n    *   If an entity or relationship was **truncated, had missing fields, or was otherwise incorrectly formatted** in the last task, re-output the *corrected and complete* version in the specified format.\n3.  **Output Format - Entities:** Output a total of 4 fields for each entity, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line. The first field *must* be the literal string `entity`.\n4.  **Output Format - Relationships:** Output a total of 5 fields for each relationship, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line. The first field *must* be the literal string `relation`.\n5.  **Output Content Only:** Output *only* the extracted list of entities and relationships. Do not include any introductory or concluding remarks, explanations, or additional text before or after the list.\n6.  **Completion Signal:** Output `<|COMPLETE|>` as the final line after all relevant missing or corrected entities and relationships have been extracted and presented.\n7.  **Output Language:** Ensure the output language is English. Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) must be kept in their original language and not translated.\n\n<Output>\n---Role---\nYou are a Knowledge Graph Specialist responsible for extracting entities and relationships from the input text.\n\n---Instructions---\n1.  **Entity Extraction & Output:**\n    *   **Identification:** Identify clearly defined and meaningful entities in the input text.\n    *   **Entity Details:** For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n        *   `entity_name`: The name of the entity. If the entity name is case-insensitive, capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case). Ensure **consistent naming** across the entire extraction process.\n        *   `entity_type`: Categorize the entity using one of the following types: `Person,Creature,Organization,Location,Event,Concept,Method,Content,Data,Artifact,NaturalObject`. If none of the provided entity types apply, do not add new entity type and classify it as `Other`.\n        *   `entity_description`: Provide a concise yet comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, based *solely* on the information present in the input text.\n    *   **Output Format - Entities:** Output a total of 4 fields for each entity, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line. The first field *must* be the literal string `entity`.\n        *   Format: `entity<|#|>entity_name<|#|>entity_type<|#|>entity_description`\n\n2.  **Relationship Extraction & Output:**\n    *   **Identification:** Identify direct, clearly stated, and meaningful relationships between previously extracted entities.\n    *   **N-ary Relationship Decomposition:** If a single statement describes a relationship involving more than two entities (an N-ary relationship), decompose it into multiple binary (two-entity) relationship pairs for separate description.\n        *   **Example:** For \"Alice, Bob, and Carol collaborated on Project X,\" extract binary relationships such as \"Alice collaborated with Project X,\" \"Bob collaborated with Project X,\" and \"Carol collaborated with Project X,\" or \"Alice collaborated with Bob,\" based on the most reasonable binary interpretations.\n    *   **Relationship Details:** For each binary relationship, extract the following fields:\n        *   `source_entity`: The name of the source entity. Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `target_entity`: The name of the target entity. Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `relationship_keywords`: One or more high-level keywords summarizing the overarching nature, concepts, or themes of the relationship. Multiple keywords within this field must be separated by a comma `,`. **DO NOT use `<|#|>` for separating multiple keywords within this field.**\n        *   `relationship_description`: A concise explanation of the nature of the relationship between the source and target entities, providing a clear rationale for their connection.\n    *   **Output Format - Relationships:** Output a total of 5 fields for each relationship, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line. The first field *must* be the literal string `relation`.\n        *   Format: `relation<|#|>source_entity<|#|>target_entity<|#|>relationship_keywords<|#|>relationship_description`\n\n3.  **Delimiter Usage Protocol:**\n    *   The `<|#|>` is a complete, atomic marker and **must not be filled with content**. It serves strictly as a field separator.\n    *   **Incorrect Example:** `entity<|#|>Tokyo<|location|>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`\n    *   **Correct Example:** `entity<|#|>Tokyo<|#|>location<|#|>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`\n\n4.  **Relationship Direction & Duplication:**\n    *   Treat all relationships as **undirected** unless explicitly stated otherwise. Swapping the source and target entities for an undirected relationship does not constitute a new relationship.\n    *   Avoid outputting duplicate relationships.\n\n5.  **Output Order & Prioritization:**\n    *   Output all extracted entities first, followed by all extracted relationships.\n    *   Within the list of relationships, prioritize and output those relationships that are **most significant** to the core meaning of the input text first.\n\n6.  **Context & Objectivity:**\n    *   Ensure all entity names and descriptions are written in the **third person**.\n    *   Explicitly name the subject or object; **avoid using pronouns** such as `this article`, `this paper`, `our company`, `I`, `you`, and `he/she`.\n\n7.  **Language & Proper Nouns:**\n    *   The entire output (entity names, keywords, and descriptions) must be written in `English`.\n    *   Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) should be retained in their original language if a proper, widely accepted translation is not available or would cause ambiguity.\n\n8.  **Completion Signal:** Output the literal string `<|COMPLETE|>` only after all entities and relationships, following all criteria, have been completely extracted and outputted.\n\n---Examples---\n<Input Text>\n```\nwhile Alex clenched his jaw, the buzz of frustration dull against the backdrop of Taylor's authoritarian certainty. It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.\n\nThen Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. \"If this tech can be understood...\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \"It could change the game for us. For all of us.\"\n\nThe underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands. Jordan looked up, and for a fleeting heartbeat, their eyes locked with Taylor's, a wordless clash of wills softening into an uneasy truce.\n\nIt was a small transformation, barely perceptible, but one that Alex noted with an inward nod.

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

Its layout follows a left-to-right linear flow representing the workflow: 1) A left rectangular box labeled '输入文本' (Input Text) with an example sentence; 2) A highlighted blue block labeled '添加指示性提示' (Add Indicative Prompt) inserting a task-specific prompt (e.g., '判断情感：') before the input; 3) A central block labeled '预训练语言模型' (Pre-trained Language Model) with a simplified neural network icon; 4) A right output box labeled '输出结果' (Output Result) showing the model’s response (e.g., '积极'). \n\nDirectional arrows connect these elements to indicate sequence. The color scheme is monochromatic with blue accents for the prompt block to emphasize its role. Lines are crisp, text uses a sans-serif font, and the style is minimalist, suitable for technical documentation. \n\nThis diagram aligns with the surrounding context of section 4.2 '指示微调（Prompt-tuning）篇' in the AiGC Interview Guide, specifically supporting subsection 4.2.2 '指示微调思路是什么?' (What is the idea of Prompt-tuning?) by visually simplifying the core concept of adding task prompts to guide pre-trained models without full parameter fine-tuning.\n```\n[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"---Task---\\nExtract entities and relationships from the input text to be processed.\\n\\n---Instructions---\\n1.  **Strict Adherence to Format:** Strictly adhere to all format requirements for entity and relationship lists, including output order, field delimiters, and proper noun handling, as specified in the system prompt.\\n2.  **Output Content Only:** Output *only* the extracted list of entities and relationships.
